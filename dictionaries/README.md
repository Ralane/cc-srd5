# SRD5 spellcheck wordlists

This directory contains a generic line-separated wordlist of valid terms from the *SRD 5.1* caught by spellcheckers, and a `dictgen.sh` script to output wordlists and dictionaries for spellchecking tools.

There are some exceptional uses of terms in the *SRD* that intentionally don't have wordlist entries:

- **Singular "erinyes".** The *SRD* doesn't use the Greek singular "erinys". Both singular and plural forms use "erinyes".
